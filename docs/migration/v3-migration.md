# Migration plan

This page outlines key changes and important details to consider when migrating. It highlights what’s new, what’s changed, and any steps you need to take to ensure a smooth transition. This isn’t a full step-by-step guide but a quick reference to help you navigate the most critical parts of the migration process.

## Navigation

All navigation controls have been merged into one `NavigationView`, inspired by Win UI.

## Icons

All icons are based on the new `IconElement` control. They replaced icons in `TitleBar`, `NavigationView`, `Button` and other controls.

## Control Gallery

Inspired by **Win UI Controls Gallery**, a new application for testing and browsing controls was created -** WPF UI Gallery**. It replaced the Demo app.

## Dialogs

`ContentDialog`, `MessageBox` and `Snackbar` have been modified, their interfaces are not fully compatible.
